Can I get it all back?<br>
The mellow hi-s<br>
The beautiful smiles<br>
Can I get it all back?
<br><br>
Petty fights<br>
Mischeivous eyes<br>
Those were the days<br>
Can I get it all back?
<br><br>
The long talks<br>
Like adventurous walks<br>
Was the discovery of<br>
Beautiful life<br>
Can I get it all back?
<br><br>
I never imagined<br>
For God's sake<br>
It will all vanish<br>
Like things that perish<br>
More like a nightmare<br>
Say, separating in a fare<br>
It all happened<br>
Unlike I imagined<br>
Trapped into a wall<br>
Grasping for it all<br>
Bracing the fall<br>
After the fall<br>
And here I am<br>
Missing you fam<br>
Can I get it all back?
<br><br>
Words aren't enough<br>
To say it all<br>
But<br>
Can I just<br>
Get it all back?
