<center>
I see the tears in your eyes<br>
I think there is no reason to hide
<br><br>
Years passed by<br>
Moments evolved<br>
Into this time
<br><br>
The silence<br>
Inaudible emotions<br>
Say it all
<br><br>
Please speak up<br>
Open your heart<br>
There is much to say<br>
Forgetting is an art
<br><br>
I see the tears in your eyes<br>
I think there is no reason to hide
