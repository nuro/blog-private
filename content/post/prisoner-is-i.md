Life is so strange<br>
Full of craze<br>
I thought it may be forgetful<br>
You proved it may be magical<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Drifting in the sunshine<br>
Apricots and wine<br>
You and I<br>
Ever be my<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Too many times<br>
I tried to hide<br>
Oh, love from thy<br>
But you let that chime<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Full of peace<br>
When pulled the reins<br>
It must be beautiful<br>
That doom’s day<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
I tried forgetting<br>
The dreams of life<br>
But you held on<br>
O, love of my<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Please let me go<br>
I can’t handle<br>
Fearing morrow<br>
The days of sorrow<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Worldly desires<br>
Monthly wires<br>
You craved it<br>
I craved you<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
Free me, I pleased<br>
Leave me, thy<br>
To where I picked<br>
This love of my<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I
<br><br>
As I sleep<br>
You wake me up<br>
I catch for you<br>
But you disappear<br>
Please hold on<br>
Or let me go<br>
Before it’s too late<br>
To move on<br>
Love is unforgiving<br>
Prisoner is I.
