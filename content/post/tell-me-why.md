Sleepless nights<br>
Un-flown kites<br>
Is this love<br>
Tell me why?
<br><br>
Fumbled talks<br>
Disastrous walks<br>
Looking for you<br>
Shying from you<br>
Is this love<br>
Tell me why?
<br><br>
Things I blurt<br>
Taken as flirt<br>
Hidden feelings<br>
Fearing love<br>
Things are liked<br>
People are loved<br>
Is this love<br>
Tell me why?
<br><br>
Regular risks<br>
Joyous frisks<br>
Is this love<br>
Tell me why?
<br><br>
I am obsessed<br>
Rather over possessed<br>
They believe<br>
I am lost<br>
Is this love<br>
Tell me why?
<br><br>
Things I fear<br>
Are hidden under<br>
If disclosed<br>
Will disaster<br>
So I hide<br>
And shall hide<br>
For I not<br>
Want you to leave<br>
Things are fine<br>
As they are<br>
Because change<br>
For radical things<br>
Aren’t successful as they seem<br>
This is love<br>
I don’t know why.
