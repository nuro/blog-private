I still recall<br>
That beautiful day<br>
You like a doll<br>
Mesmerized was I<br>
Lost was I<br>
Then you said hi<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
I looked for something cool<br>
As reply to you<br>
But I fumbled<br>
Weird as usual<br>
Then you smiled<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
Then the internet<br>
Sleepless nights<br>
Pinging nights<br>
Happy nights<br>
Missed you I<br>
When you said goodbye<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
I decided to<br>
Give you a gift<br>
Something different<br>
A gift to a gift<br>
It took me time<br>
To decided Choco pie!<br>
That particular moment<br>
<br><br>
From something different<br>
To a mere Choco pie<br>
My thoughts were consumed<br>
In the vacuum of you<br>
But how I gave it<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
Three days, all in vain<br>
Nothing more than a hey<br>
Shaking legs, red faced<br>
I decided and gift I gave<br>
Then you smiled<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
I lied the gift not for me<br>
I got only for thee<br>
But feelings consumed<br>
Words disaster-ed<br>
I fumbled<br>
Then you cuddled<br>
That particular moment
<br><br>
Taking calculated risks<br>
All for you<br>
Running across brinks<br>
All for you<br>
Give me time<br>
All for you<br>
That particular moment<br>
All for you.
