How do I say<br>
What do I say<br>
You are the light<br>
Holding my sight
<br><br>
When I met<br>
With that smile<br>
My heart was your<br>
At first sight
<br><br>
Never to realise<br>
That was drifting<br>
Drifting us close<br>
Was that time
<br><br>
I swear<br>
I will be there<br>
Everytime<br>
For you<br>
Not like a lover<br>
More like a soldier<br>
Supporting you<br>
From the distress
<br><br>
Words fall short<br>
To thank you the most<br>
You are the one<br>
To make 'us'
<br><br>
How do I say<br>
What do I say<br>
You are the light<br>
Holding my sight
