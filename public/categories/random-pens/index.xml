      <description>I see the tears in your eyes
I think there is no reason to hide Years passed by
Moments evolved
Into this time The silence
Inaudible emotions
Say it all Please speak up
Open your heart
There is much to say
Forgetting is an art I see the tears in your eyes
I think there is no reason to hide</description>

      <description>How do I say
What do I say
You are the light
Holding my sight When I met
With that smile
My heart was your
At first sight Never to realise
That was drifting
Drifting us close
Was that time I swear
I will be there
Everytime
For you
Not like a lover
More like a soldier
Supporting you
From the distress Words fall short
To thank you the most</description>

      <title>Can I Get it All Back?</title>

      <description>Can I get it all back?
The mellow hi-s
The beautiful smiles
Can I get it all back? Petty fights
Mischeivous eyes
Those were the days
Can I get it all back? The long talks
Like adventurous walks
Was the discovery of
Beautiful life
Can I get it all back? I never imagined
For God&amp;rsquo;s sake
It will all vanish
Like things that perish
More like a nightmare
Say, separating in a fare</description>

      <description>I am here
Waiting for you
You are there
Waiting for him
It&amp;rsquo;s all about choices My pen bleeds
Inner voice seeps
Mist on lenses
Say it all
It&amp;rsquo;s all about choices More like a dream
Sweetest os the sweet
Freezing speed of life
You are there
Not with me
But happier with him
&amp;lsquo;Cause it&amp;rsquo;s all about choices</description>

      <title>That Particular Moment</title>

      <description>I still recall
That beautiful day
You like a doll
Mesmerized was I
Lost was I
Then you said hi
That particular moment I looked for something cool
As reply to you
But I fumbled
Weird as usual
Then you smiled
That particular moment Then the internet
Sleepless nights
Pinging nights
Happy nights
Missed you I
When you said goodbye
That particular moment I decided to
Give you a gift</description>

      <title>Tell Me Why</title>

      <guid>https://www.ragasirtahk.tk/2018/08/tell-me-why/</guid>
      <description>Sleepless nights
Un-flown kites
Is this love
Tell me why? Fumbled talks
Disastrous walks
Looking for you
Shying from you
Is this love
Tell me why? Things I blurt
Taken as flirt
Hidden feelings
Fearing love
Things are liked
People are loved
Is this love
Tell me why? Regular risks
Joyous frisks
Is this love
Tell me why? I am obsessed
Rather over possessed
They believe
I am lost</description>

      <title>So Strange</title>

      <guid>https://www.ragasirtahk.tk/2018/08/so-strange/</guid>
      <description>When I was young
I used to believe
People hide feelings
It’s so strange I met you
Eye met you
The world whispered
And I fumbled
Grasping for words
Easing me there
Was that smile
Frozen moments
Void speed of life
Tearing me apart
Killing from within
There was that feeling
The feeling that I hide Now I understand
Now I believe
People hide feelings
It’s not so strange.</description>

      <description>Life is so strange
Full of craze
I thought it may be forgetful
You proved it may be magical
Love is unforgiving
Prisoner is I Drifting in the sunshine
Apricots and wine
You and I
Ever be my
Love is unforgiving
Prisoner is I Too many times
I tried to hide
Oh, love from thy
But you let that chime
Love is unforgiving
Prisoner is I Full of peace</description>

      <description>People have secrets
My secret is you
Every poet has a story
My story is you
God gives gifts
He gave me you
Love is power
My power is you
Dreams are beautiful
Beautiful is you
Worldly desires
My desire is you
People seek love
I seek you
Words are few
To describe you
Magic is now
Thanks to you
Oh, mother
Oh, father
I love you
All this is for you.</description>

      <description>I be the man
You be the girl
I flip the pan
You swing the curl You carry love
I carry heart
Beautiful dove
Leads our cart 14 years
Wonderful marriage
You serve the platter
I lead the carriage Lost in thoughts
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry a lot
I earn the notes
You prepare the cot I may be weird
But I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you cheered
I may be ugly
But I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you cuddly You say I flirt</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s you
Stuck in the cue
Dreaming about things
Fresh and new Will you get ahead
Removing things
Relishing memories
Out of your head? This obsession
Taking your possession
Will they believe
You deserved a mention? It gets harder
Know not why
Will they remember
The magical time? It&amp;rsquo;s you
As always
Stuck in the cue
Gloomy days They return.</description>

      <description>The first time
I saw you
You had my sight
Withheld by might
And then you smile
That first time I wondered why
If anytime
Will you talk?
Will you walk?
Beside me
For first time The chain of
Attraction
Losing our
Traction
Were you
Mine?
That first time You wipe my
Tears
Forgiving my fears
I ain’t feeble
It’s just the past
And you understood
That first time Walking the dangers</description>

      <description>You are the one
Oh, the reason for smile
Love in the Californian drive
The soul of my emptiness
You are the one
Yeah, you are the one You bring me to life
Hope in the darkness
For let the sunshine
Remove the clouds
Uplifting my soul
You are the one
Yeah, you are the one Counting the stars
Those silly nights
The petty fights
The empty minds
You are the one</description>

      <description>I swear I miss you
The magical nights
The 3 AM fights
The promises of life
I swear, Oh, I swear
I still miss you High octane days
My octave maze
You were the guide
Fighting my odds
More like a torch
I swear, Oh, I swear
I still miss you Then the darker days
The world’s odds
I don’t know why
Why you leave me
I swear, Oh, I swear</description>

      <description>Dear reason
I was a bully
A sadist
You were a magic
A beauty Dear reason
I was quiet
Hiding things
Un-notified pings
You were might
Morphed me
Oh, reason Life was history
Love: uncovered mystery
Hidden wisdoms
Unspoken kingdoms
Entered thy
Morphing my
Oh, reason Dear reason
I am a supporter
A lover
You changed me
Wow, reason Dear reason
Neglected things
Now magical
Imagination wings
Euphoria
Beautiful now</description>

      <description>I recall
You did the talks
Mystical walks
Withholding me
Imaginary? You were shy
My heart’s pie
Living me softly
Sans efforts
Imaginary? I was worn
Heavenly light!
I was blessed
I lived
Imaginary? That’s history
More like mystery
Unwept thoughts
Remind me
You were there
Imaginary.</description>
