      <description>Google Code-in 2017 results were anounced on 31 January 2018. And I was chosen one of the finalists for Drupal! Congrats to all other winners.

 I know this post is coming a bit late because of my grade 11 exams. I wrote this post as soon as I got a break from studies.
This was the first time that I participated in Google Code-in.</description>
